# CSV File Preview Application

I have created a simple CSV file preview application using Streamlit, a user-friendly and effective Python library. This application allows users to easily upload and view CSV files, providing a convenient way to preview the contents and structure of their data.

As a beginner, I designed this application as a small project to gain hands-on experience with Streamlit and its deployment process. Despite its simplicity, this application serves as a valuable learning experience and a practical tool for previewing CSV files.
